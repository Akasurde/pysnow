   examples
   client
   query
   request


Installation
------------
# pip install pysnow

Limitations
-----------
Currently `delete()` and `update()` operations only works for queries yielding a single result.
If there's a demand, delete_multiple() and update_multiple() will be implemented into the API to avoid accidents.

Compatibility
-------------
pysnow is compatible with both Python 2 and 3. It's been tested in Python 2.7 and Python 3.4.
